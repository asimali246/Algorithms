Two segments (p1,q1) and (p2,q2) intersect if and only if one of the following two conditions is verified

1. General Case:
- (p1, q1, p2) and (p1, q1, q2) have different orientations and
- (p2, q2, p1) and (p2, q2, q1) have different orientations

2. Special Case 
- (p1, q1, p2), (p1, q1, q2), (p2, q2, p1), and (p2, q2, q1) are all collinear and
- the x-projections of (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) intersect
- the y-projections of (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) intersect
